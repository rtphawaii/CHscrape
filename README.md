Chrome Hearts is a brick and mortar store that sells mens and womens fashion items.
They have 9 locations in the US. 
The resale value of their pieces is high because they do not have a complete webstore.
Grailed is a second hand fashion marketplace and Chrome Hearts is a coveted brand on the site. Grailed has a page where you can see the listings sold. 
# Chrome Hearts has sold 6,800 jewelry items to date, some pieces fetch over $10k and double their original asking price. 
By scraping listings and their selling price we can understand which pieces garner a higher resale price and are more popular. Luckily, I also live right next to 1 of the 9 stores so I can go and buy the item and list it if I know it will sell based on the data.
